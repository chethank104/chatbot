Our project consists of an educational chatbot and a string manipulation tool. The chatbot provides predefined responses based on user input related to educational topics, while the string script counts occurrences of a substring in a given string. Data storage options include databases (like SQLite with SQLAlchemy), file-based storage (JSON), and session-based temporary storage. The project uses technologies like Flask for the chatbot, Python scripting for string operations, and XAMPP for database storage. Your PowerPoint presentation will cover the chatbotâ€™s functionality, data storage methods, components used, and the overall architecture of the project. Let me know if you need any modifications!
